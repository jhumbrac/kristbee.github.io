	<p id="slogan">Losing yourself is better than losing your mind...</p>

		<p> My two passions in life have always been travel and music. <br>
	  	While I am home, abroad or at a city nearby, I always try to go <br>
	  	search out the local music scene, whether it be good, bad, or <br>just an experience I will not forget.  I wanted to combine <br>traveling, meeting new people, and experiences in one place.</p>
