<h2 id="slogan">Losing yourself is better than losing your mind...

</h2>

	<p> My two passions in life have always been travel and music. <br>
	  While I am home, abroad or at a city nearby, I always try to go <br>
	  search out the local music scene, whether it be good, bad, or <br>just an experience I will not forget.  I wanted to combine <br>traveling, meeting new people, and experiences in one place.</p>
<hr>
	<ul>A few of the things your may find here are:
	<li>A range of emotions</li>
	<li>Confusion</li>
	<li>Humor</li>
	<li>Mystery and Intrigue</li>
	<li>Relatable stories to anyone in their 30s</li>
	</ul>
